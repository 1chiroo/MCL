--- MCL Justice Department Activity Checker ---
This tool is exclusively for members of the MCL Justice Department to investigate
player activity within the competitive server, MCL. It is designed to be
deployed **after** initial suspicion arises from observed gameplay or submitted clips,
serving as a forensic utility to gather concrete evidence of unauthorized software,
exploits, or modifications used to gain an unfair advantage. And its only to be used under **reasonable suspicion**


Please note: This is primarily an **activity checker** and provides a quick, simple
way to identify common cheat indicators. It is **not as comprehensive or reliable
as a full PC check**, which delves deeper into system forensics, memory analysis,
and kernel-level activity. This tool serves as an initial, easy-to-use filter,
but does not replace the thoroughness of a dedicated, in-depth PC inspection.


Specifically, this checker performs a deep system analysis to identify digital
fingerprints associated with common Roblox cheats and exploit tools, including:
  ??? File System Scan: Locates suspicious executable files, DLLs, or archives (like '.exe', '.zip', '.rar')
    often associated with Roblox exploits or cheat injection.
  ??? Registry Analysis (MuiCache, Run Keys, UserAssist): Uncovers evidence of previously executed exploit clients,
    programs set to auto-start, or traces in user activity logs that indicate
    the presence or past use of cheating software.
  ??? Prefetch Data Examination: Scans Windows Prefetch files (records of launched applications) to reveal
    historical execution of suspicious Roblox-related exploit or cheat programs.
  ??? Active Process & Network Connection Monitoring: Identifies currently running processes and their network activity that
    correspond to known Roblox exploit names or unusual connections, suggesting
    active cheating.
  ??? Scheduled Tasks Inspection: Checks for covert scheduled tasks that could be utilized by cheats for
    persistence, auto-updates, or delayed execution.


The objective is to provide the Justice Department with clear, actionable data to
support disciplinary decisions, ensuring a fair and competitive environment within MCL.
